# dwm

Settings for the window manager dwm on my [ASUS Zenbook UX305LA](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305LA/specifications/)

## Patches

I use only those three patches (Â© their respective authors)

* [noborder](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder): removes the border when only one window is visible.
* [attachaside](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachaside): attaches new windows to the right, in the stacking area.
* [pertag](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag): allows to use a different layout on each workspace.


The `dwm-6.1-attachaside-tagfix.diff` patch had to be fixed to apply without errors, see  `dwm-6.1-attachaside-tagfix-fixed.diff`. For simplicity, the three patches have been combined in `dwm-6.1-combined.diff`.


## config.h

UI preferences (colors). This config file adds a bunch of functions to use/emulate the function keys (set volume and brightness, toggle touchpad) and a shortcut to take a screenshot.

* __fn + f11__: decrease volume
* __fn + f12__: increase volume
* __fn + f10__: mute
* __win + f5__: decrease luminosity
* __win + f6__: increase luminosity
* __win + printscr__: take a screenshot
* __win + s__: lock the screen with `slock`

Change the layout for some programs. Chromium will launch be on the 9th workspace. Xmessage
is floating and visible on every workspace (used for alerts). The class can be found with
`xprop(1)`.

```
/* class      instance    title       tags mask     isfloating   monitor */
{ "Firefox",  NULL,       NULL,       1 << 7,       0,           -1 },
{ "chromium-browser",NULL,NULL,       1 << 8,       0,           -1 },
{ "MPlayer",  NULL,       NULL,       1 << 7,       0,           -1 },
{ "Xmessage", NULL,       NULL,       ~0,           1,           -1 },
```


## Scripts

Just throw them in your `$HOME/bin`

* `hwinfo`: displays the CPU frequency and temperature, the remaining charge of the battery and fire an alert when battery is almost discharged.
* `luminosity`: uses `xrandr(1)` to modify the screen luminosity. This is a software modification, unfortunately `xbacklight(1)` is not working.
* `toggle-touchpad`: connects/disconnects the touchpad.
* `screenshot`: takes a screenshot and saves it to the specified `Sdir`. Requires `import` from `ImageMagick`.

## Patch and recompile `dwm` on OpenBSD

```sh
make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm clean clean=packages
make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm patch
cp config.h /usr/ports/pobj/dwm-6.1/dwm-6.1/
patch /usr/ports/pobj/dwm-6.1/dwm-6.1/dwm.c dwm-6.1-combined.diff
make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm rebuild
make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm reinstall
make patch
```

## Status bar

Add this to your `.xinitrc`:

```
while true
do
        xsetroot -name "`hwinfo` | `date +"%a %e %b %H:%M"`"
        sleep 30
done &
exec dwm
```
