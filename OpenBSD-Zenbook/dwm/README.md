dwm
ettings for the window manager [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) on my [ASUS Zenbook UX305LA](https://www
.asus.com/Notebooks/ASUS-ZenBook-UX305LA/specifications/)

## patches

I use only those three patches (\xc2\xa9 their respective authors)

* [noborder](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder): removes the border w
hen only one window is visible.
* [attachaside](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachaside): attaches new w
indows to the right, in the stacking area.
* [pertag](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag): allows to use a differen
t layout on each workspace.


The `attachaside` patch had to be fixed to apply without errors, see  `fixed
`. For simplicity the three patches have been combined in `combined.diff`.

### How to apply (on OpenBSD)

```sh
# make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm clean clean=packages
# make -C /usr/ports/x11/dwm patch
# cp config.h /usr/ports/pobj/dwm-6.1/dwm-6.1/

## config.h

UI preferences (colors). Add a bunch of functions to use/emulate the function keys (set volume and brightness, toggle touchpad) and a shortcut to take a screenshot.

* fn + f12: increase volume
* fn + f11: decrease volume
* fn + f10: mute
* win + f5: decrease luminosity
* win + f6: increase luminosity
* win + printscr: take a screenshot

## Scripts

* `hwinfo`: displays the CPU frequency and temperature, the remaining charge of the battery and fire an alert when battery is low.
* `luminosity`: uses xrandr to modify the screen luminosity. This is a software modification, unfortunately `xbacklight(1)` is not working.
* `toggle-touchpad`: connects/disconnets the touchpad.
* `screenshot`: takes a screenshot and save it to `dir`, requires `import` from `ImageMagick`.
